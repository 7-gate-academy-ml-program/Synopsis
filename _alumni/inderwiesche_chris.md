My name is Chris Inderwiesche (Inder-Wish), I graduated with a BS in
Computer Engineering in 2016. I am currently working as a Software
Engineer at NavAir (Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division) in
Ridgecrest, California. I am doing a program called the ESDP
(Engineering and Science Development Program). My company, NavAir,
builds and tests weapons in order to bring those weapons and designs
to the Navy Fleet to protect and bring home our war fighters safe and
sound.  While at UCSB, I took many different classes, ranging from
android programming to creating operational circuitry. There are a
vast number of classes and programs that can be taken in order to help
further advance the knowledge of a student that is attending
UCSB. During these classes and programs, it is highly recommended to
interact with all students involved. This is important to be able to
build contacts, collaborate on assignments to get a different
prospective on how to approach problems, and learn overall interactive
skills (this helps in the real world because you will be working with
many different people at a new job!!!)

What was great about obtaining a UCSB BS Computer Engineering degree
was the amount of fun I had and all of the knowledge I obtained. Some
may not think of the work they do is important / used in the real
world, but a good portion of what I learned is used very often!!! The
amount of the knowledge gained in these classes work as "stepping
stones" into the real world. Some of the assignments in classes may
seem a bit "over the top" and maybe not "useful" in the real world,
yet, from doing these assignments, whether struggling with them or
just breezing by them, allows the student to understand how projects
combine information and expand the knowledge of the student(s) who
were involved.

Hopefully everyone who wants to attend UCSB should know that
Engineering / Computer Science programs offered here are great and
will prepare you for the real world. Also, who doesnâ€™t want to attend
a school right next to the beach with beautiful weather 24/7?
