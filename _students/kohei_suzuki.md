Came to Vancouver in April 2017 from Yokohama, Japan.
I have taken some courses in Machine Learning on Coursera, and have 6 months of
working experience at a startup as a Machine Learning engineer intern.
While I was working at the company, I realized that I should be more familiar
with data processing which I will be getting better at through this Bootcamp.
What I spend most of the time for is studying statistics with R programming
language and also studying ENGLISH.
