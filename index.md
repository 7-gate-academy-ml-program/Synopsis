<h2>About this website</h2>

This website is a volunteer effort (not an official UCSB department website) to provide a sample of:
* what some graduates of the Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) undergrad programs at UCSB are doing now.
* a few interesting things that current CS and CE are doing at UCSB beyond the standard curriculum, such as undergraduate research, internships, and leadership in student organizations.

The CCS Computing program at UCSB maintains a similar website here: <http://ucsb-ccs-computing.github.io>
